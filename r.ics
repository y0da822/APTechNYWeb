DESCRIPTION:An ocean of blood. The only hope left after The Quiet Rapture.
  In the rusting halls of crumbling space stations\, the last remnants of 
 humanity craft a submarine to explore the bleeding depths... and weld one
  soul inside to pilot it. But hope in this void is as illusionary as the 
 starlight. This is not an expedition. It's an execution.
